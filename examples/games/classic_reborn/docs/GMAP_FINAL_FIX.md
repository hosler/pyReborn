# GMAP Movement - Final Fix

## The Core Issue

You were right - the GMAP boundaries weren't being updated as levels loaded. The physics system was checking if movement would go outside GMAP bounds, but it thought the GMAP was only 1x1 (the default) instead of 3x3 (chicken.gmap's actual size).

## What Was Happening

1. **Connection Manager**: Correctly parsed chicken.gmap as 3x3
2. **GMAP Handler**: Still had default dimensions of 1x1
3. **Physics System**: Blocked movement beyond segment [0,0] because it thought that was the entire GMAP

## The Fix

I've added code to synchronize GMAP dimensions between components:

1. **Connection Manager** parses GMAP files and stores dimensions
2. **Game Client** now updates the GMAP handler's dimensions when levels are received
3. **GMAP Handler** can update its dimensions from external sources
4. **Physics System** uses these dimensions to allow movement across all segments

## Implementation Details

### In classic_reborn_client.py:
```python
# Update GMAP dimensions from connection manager if available
if hasattr(self.connection_manager, 'gmap_data') and self.connection_manager.current_gmap:
    gmap_info = self.connection_manager.gmap_data.get(self.connection_manager.current_gmap)
    if gmap_info and (self.gmap_handler.gmap_width == 1 or self.gmap_handler.gmap_height == 1):
        self.gmap_handler.gmap_width = gmap_info['width']
        self.gmap_handler.gmap_height = gmap_info['height']
        logger.info(f"[GMAP] Updated dimensions: {self.gmap_handler.gmap_width}x{self.gmap_handler.gmap_height}")
```

### In gmap_handler.py:
```python
def update_dimensions(self, width: int, height: int):
    """Update GMAP dimensions"""
    if self.gmap_width != width or self.gmap_height != height:
        logger.info(f"[GMAP] Dimensions updated: {self.gmap_width}x{self.gmap_height} -> {width}x{height}")
        self.gmap_width = width
        self.gmap_height = height
```

### In physics.py:
```python
# Check GMAP dimensions if available
if hasattr(gmap_handler, 'gmap_width') and hasattr(gmap_handler, 'gmap_height'):
    if seg_x >= gmap_handler.gmap_width or seg_y >= gmap_handler.gmap_height:
        logger.info(f"[PHYSICS] Outside GMAP bounds: segment [{seg_x}, {seg_y}] exceeds GMAP size")
        return False
```

## Testing

Run the info display script to verify dimensions are being updated:
```bash
python testing/show_gmap_info.py
```

You should see:
- "Parsed GMAP chicken.gmap: 3x3"
- "[GMAP] Updated dimensions: 1x1 -> 3x3"

Now you should be able to move freely across all 9 segments of the chicken GMAP!
