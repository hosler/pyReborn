# GMAP Boundary Movement Analysis

## The Real Issue

The problem isn't with the movement system itself - it's with collision detection at segment boundaries.

### What's Happening

1. **Player Position**: When at x=62, the player appears to have room to move right
2. **Collision Box**: The collision box extends 1.6 tiles to the right (x_offset + shadow_width)
3. **Boundary Check**: At x=62, the collision box extends to x=63.6
4. **Segment Problem**: When checking collision at x=63.6, we need to check the adjacent segment
5. **Blocking**: If the adjacent segment isn't loaded, the physics system blocks movement

### Why You Get Stuck

When you approach x=62 and try to move right:
- Your position would be x=62.5
- Your collision box would extend to x=64.1
- This crosses into the next segment
- If that segment isn't loaded, movement is blocked

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Allow Movement to Unloaded Segments**: Changed physics to allow movement when adjacent segment isn't loaded (it will trigger loading)

2. **Preload Adjacent Segments**: When within 5 tiles of a boundary, ensure adjacent segments are requested

3. **Better Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to track exactly what's blocking movement

## Testing

Run the debug script to see detailed physics logs:
```bash
python testing/debug_boundary_movement.py
```

This will show:
- When collision points cross segment boundaries
- Which segments are being checked
- Why movement is being blocked

## Next Steps

If movement is still restricted, the issue might be:
1. The server itself restricting movement to 64x64
2. The collision box being too large for boundary crossing
3. Adjacent segments not loading fast enough

Try moving slowly towards boundaries and watch the debug output to see exactly what's happening.
