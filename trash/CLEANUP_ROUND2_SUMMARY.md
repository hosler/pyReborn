# PyReborn Second Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Incorporated Enhanced Events into Base System
- **Merged** `events_enhanced.py` functionality into `events.py`
- The base `EventManager` now supports both:
  - `EventType` enum events (original)
  - String events (from enhanced version)
- **Removed** `events_enhanced.py` as it's now redundant

### 2. Cleaned Up Unused Imports
- **Removed** unused `PacketBuilder` import from `client.py`

### 3. Fixed Test Bot
- Updated `test_bot.py` to use the base `EventManager` instead of the removed enhanced version

## Benefits
1. **Simpler architecture** - One event system instead of two
2. **Better integration** - Enhanced features are now part of the core library
3. **Cleaner imports** - No more deciding between base and enhanced events
4. **Same functionality** - All tests continue to pass

## Current Status
- All 10 tests in `test_bot.py` pass âœ…
- Library is cleaner and more cohesive
- Event system supports both enum and string events natively
