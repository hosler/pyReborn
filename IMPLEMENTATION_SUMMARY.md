# PyReborn Implementation Summary

## Overview
PyReborn is a Python library for connecting to GServer (Graal Reborn servers) with complete protocol support for packet encryption, parsing, and game functionality.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. Encryption Issues
**Problem**: Packets were failing to decrypt/decompress properly.
**Solution**: Discovered that only the first X bytes are encrypted based on compression type:
- Uncompressed (0x02): First 12 bytes
- ZLIB (0x04): First 4 bytes  
- BZ2 (0x06): First 4 bytes

### 2. Packet ID Extraction
**Problem**: Packet IDs appeared random, no heartbeat packets visible.
**Solution**: Fixed extraction to use `decrypted[0] - 32` instead of `decrypted[1]`.

### 3. Player Property Parsing
**Problem**: Nicknames appeared garbled, unknown properties encountered.
**Solution**: 
- Added support for PLPROP_X2/Y2/Z2 (high-precision coordinates)
- Fixed property parsing to handle both old and new formats
- Properties have no terminator - parse until packet exhausted

### 4. Packet Fragmentation
**Problem**: Incomplete packets, missing data.
**Solution**: Implemented proper packet batching with newline terminators.

## Library Architecture

### Core Components
1. **client.py** - Main GraalClient class
2. **encryption.py** - ENCRYPT_GEN_5 implementation
3. **packet_handler.py** - Packet parsing logic
4. **session.py** - Session management and tracking
5. **events.py** - Event system
6. **protocol/** - Packet definitions and enums

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Connection and authentication
- ✅ Packet encryption/decryption (GEN_5)
- ✅ Player tracking (self and others)
- ✅ Chat messaging (public and private)
- ✅ Movement and animations
- ✅ Combat (bombs, arrows, projectiles)
- ✅ Item/inventory management
- ✅ Server flags
- ✅ Session statistics
- ✅ Event-driven architecture
- ✅ Packet buffering for bots

## Usage Examples

### Basic Connection
```python
from pyreborn import GraalClient, EventType

client = GraalClient("localhost", 14900)

@client.on(EventType.CHAT_MESSAGE)
def on_chat(player_id, message):
    print(f"Player {player_id}: {message}")

if client.connect():
    client.login("account", "password")
    client.say("Hello from pyReborn!")
```

### Player Tracking
```python
@client.on(EventType.OTHER_PLAYER_UPDATE)
def on_player(player):
    print(f"Player {player.nickname} at ({player.x}, {player.y})")
    if 'spaceman' in player.nickname.lower():
        print("Found SpaceManSpiff!")
```

### Session Management
```python
# Get comprehensive statistics
summary = client.get_session_summary()
print(f"Session duration: {summary['session_duration']:.1f}s")
print(f"Players seen: {summary['total_players_seen']}")

# Search for players
players = client.find_players_by_name("space")
```

## Testing Results
All tests passed successfully:
- Connection ✅
- Login ✅
- Events ✅
- Movement ✅
- Chat ✅
- Properties ✅
- Session ✅
- Packets ✅

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/pyreborn/session.py` - Session management system
- `/pyreborn/PACKET_ANALYSIS.md` - Protocol documentation
- `/pyreborn/README.md` - Library documentation
- `/pyreborn/examples/full_demo.py` - Complete feature demonstration
- Various test and debug scripts

### Modified Files
- `/pyreborn/client.py` - Fixed packet processing, added session integration
- `/pyreborn/encryption.py` - Fixed partial encryption
- `/pyreborn/handlers/packet_handler.py` - Added missing handlers, fixed parsing
- `/pyreborn/protocol/enums.py` - Added PLPROP_X2/Y2/Z2 and missing properties

## Remaining Work
While the core functionality is complete, future enhancements could include:
- Level tile data parsing
- NPC script execution  
- Advanced weapon handling
- Guild management
- RC command support

## Conclusion
PyReborn now provides a fully functional Python interface to GServer with correct packet handling, encryption, and comprehensive game state tracking. The library successfully handles all common gameplay packets and provides both low-level packet access and high-level abstractions for bot development.
